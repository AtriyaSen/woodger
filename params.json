We use the SLATE graphical theorem prover [2], which is based on SNARK [3].\r\n\r\nEach file in this folder contains a proof in the SLATE format. The numbering scheme of [1] is followed. Files prefixed with 'tarski' contain proofs from Appendix E of [1], which is due to Alfred Tarski. The numbering scheme of this appendix is followed.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n[1] Woodger, J.
