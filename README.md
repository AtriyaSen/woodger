# README for the Woodger Project

The Woodger Project aims to obtain automated or semi-automated proofs of statements in [1]. We use the SLATE graphical theorem prover [2], which is based on SNARK [3].

Each file in this folder contains a proof in the SLATE format. The numbering scheme of [1] is followed. Files prefixed with 'tarski' contain proofs from Appendix E of [1], which is due to Alfred Tarski. The numbering scheme of this appendix is followed.
